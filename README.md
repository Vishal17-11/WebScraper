üöÄ What I Built
I built a Web Scraper API that allows users to collect structured data from complex, interactive websites like Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. This project provides an intuitive API where users can input the website and URL they want to scrape, and it returns the extracted data in a clean, structured format (JSON).

The scraper handles dynamic web content, JavaScript rendering, and pagination thanks to Bright Data‚Äôs powerful scraping technology. This solution helps businesses with:

Price aggregation: Collect and compare product prices from multiple e-commerce platforms.
Competitor monitoring: Track competitors' products, prices, and promotions.
Review aggregation: Gather user reviews from e-commerce and service platforms.
üì∏ Demo
Here‚Äôs a quick demonstration of how the API works.

The API is simple and accessible via Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client. It supports multiple websites like Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and more.

üõ†Ô∏è How I Used Bright Data
Bright Data was essential in handling the challenges of scraping dynamic, interactive, and JavaScript-heavy websites. Many modern sites load product details asynchronously, which traditional scrapers fail to capture. However, using Bright Data's Web Scraper API, I could easily:

Overcome CAPTCHA blocks
Handle client-side JavaScript rendering
Navigate complex, multi-step user interactions
Paginate through long lists of products
üî• Key Complexities Overcome
1Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Content Rendering
Websites like Amazon don't display content in raw HTML. Instead, they use JavaScript rendering to load product details. Using Bright Data‚Äôs browser-like capabilities, I was able to extract all product details dynamically.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Anti-Bot Measures
E-commerce sites employ CAPTCHAs and rate limits. Bright Data‚Äôs system seamlessly bypassed these challenges using its proxy rotation and anti-bot bypassing features.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Pagination & Infinite Scrolling
For websites with infinite scrolling, the API intelligently scrolls the page to load more content, ensuring that no product listing is missed.

üìö How It Works
The project is built using Spring Boot (Java) and integrates with Bright Data‚Äôs Web Scraper API.

‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
Spring Boot: For building the REST API.
Bright Data Web Scraper API: To handle JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHA bypass, and proxy rotation.
Postman: For testing the API.

üî• Does this submission qualify for additional prompts?
Yes, this project qualifies for:

‚ÄúUse Bright Data to handle CAPTCHA bypass and proxy rotation‚Äù
‚ÄúScrape data from an interactive, dynamic website‚Äù
‚ÄúAggregate data from multiple platforms‚Äù
These features were implemented using Bright Data's JavaScript rendering, proxy rotation, and CAPTCHA bypass functionality.
